Compiling
=========

Open Camera is compiled using Android Studio. (Versions 1.34 or earlier were compiled using Eclipse.)

Source Control
==============

The Git repository is available at https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/code/ . Note that I work with the auto crlf turned off (otherwise it converts all the Linux line endings into Windows format). If you want to work on the source, please check out the latest version from the repository.

The Git repository for the test project is also available at https://sourceforge.net/p/opencamera/tests/ .

Licence
=======

This source is released under the GPL v3 or later.
